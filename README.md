Questions

My goals in this project are to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company. If I can predict employees likely to quit, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving (because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company).
1- Do Exploratory Data analysis to figure out which variables have a direct and clear impact on employee retention
2- Plot bar charts showing the impact of employee salaries on retention
3- Plot bar charts showing a correlation between department and employee retention
4- Now build a logistic regression model using variables that were narrowed down in step 1
5- Measure the accuracy of the model
